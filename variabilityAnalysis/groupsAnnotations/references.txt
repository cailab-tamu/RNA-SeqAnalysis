"the widest family of tetrapod-specific transcription repressors" ... "KRAB-ZFP genes are evolutively recent and their expansion in the tetrapod genome strongly suggests that new functions for the encoded proteins have been generated under the selective pressure of newly acquired biological pathways. It is tempting to speculate that one of these pathways may well be the adaptive immune system, as typical instance of acquisition of new specialized functions in higher vertebrates."
